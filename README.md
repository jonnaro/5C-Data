# 5C-Data
5C analytics-related scripts used for data analysis

## Things you should know
* Running these scripts requires the use of a 5C SQLite file, which should be housed within
/data but is not included in this repository.
* I try to emulate [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) as much as possible.
